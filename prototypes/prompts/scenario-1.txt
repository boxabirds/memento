- "a" for addition e.g. add a new goal: "a": {"Goal":{"id", 1, "name": "Example goal not a real one"}}. Add a new id attribute with a unique id in the update
- "u" for update: e.g. update Milestone of an existing goal: "u": {"Goal": {"id":2, "Milestone": "New milestone"}}
- "d" for deletion. e.g. delete ReminderSchedule: "d": {"Goal": {"id":1, "ReminderSchedule": null}}
